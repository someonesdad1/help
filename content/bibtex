Standard fields                         *bibtex_standard_fields*


address
    Usually the address of the publisher or other type of institution.
    For major publishing houses, van Leunen recommends omitting the
    information entirely. For small publishers, on the other hand, you
    can help the reader by giving the complete address. 
annote
    An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography styles,
    but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography. 
author
    The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the LaTeX
    book. 
booktitle
    Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the LaTeX book
    for how to type titles. For book entries, use the title field
    instead. 
chapter
    A chapter (or section or whatever) number. 
crossref
    The database key of the entry being cross referenced. Any fields
    that are missing from the current record are inherited from the
    field being cross referenced. 
edition
    The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''. This should be an
    ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown
    here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary. 
editor
    Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book. If
    there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the
    editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears. 
howpublished
    How something strange has been published. The first word should be
    capitalized. 
institution
    The sponsoring institution of a technical report. 
journal
    A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals. 
key
    Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label
    when the ``author'' information is missing. This field should not
    be confused with the key that appears in the cite command and at
    the beginning of the database entry. 
month
    The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished
    work, in which it was written. You should use the standard
    three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the
    LaTeX book. 
note
    Any additional information that can help the reader. The first
    word should be capitalized. 
number
    The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a work
    in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
    identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues
    a technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books
    are given numbers in a named series. 
organization
    The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a
    manual. 
pages
    One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42--111 or
    7,41,73--97 or 43+ (the `+' in this last example indicates pages
    following that don't form a simple range). To make it easier to
    maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert
    a single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TeX to
    denote number ranges (as in 7--33). 
publisher
    The publisher's name. 
school
    The name of the school where a thesis was written. 
series
    The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire book,
    the the title field gives its title and an optional series field
    gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book
    is published. 
title
    The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book. 
type
    The type of a technical report---for example, ``Research Note''. 
volume
    The volume of a journal or multi-volume book. 
year
    The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year it
    was written. Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as
    1984, although the standard styles can handle any year whose last
    four nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as `\hbox{(about
    1984)}'.
