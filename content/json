JSON Overview                                               *json_overview*

The two key structures are objects (dicts) and arrays (lists)

    object:  unordered set of name/value pairs
        {
            "name1": value1,
            "name2": value2,
        }

    arrays:  ordered collection of elements
        [ value1, value2, ...]

Values
    object
    array
    string      Characters in double quotes
    number      int or float
    true        bool
    false       bool
    null        nothing or empty

Whitespace:  "", '0020', '000A', '000D', '0009'
    '0020 == U+0020 Unicode codepoint

McKeeman Form                                           *json_mckeeman_form*

McKeeman Form is a notation for expressing grammars. It was proposed by Bill McKeeman of
Dartmouth College. It is a simplified Backus-Naur Form with significant whitespace and
minimal use of metacharacters.

Grammar
We can express the grammar of McKeeman Form in McKeeman Form.

A grammar is a list of one or more rules.

    grammar
        rules

The Unicode code point U+0020 is used as the space. The Unicode code point U+000A is
used as the newline.

    space
        '0020'

    newline
        '000A'

A name is a sequence of letters or _underbar.

    name
        letter
        letter name

    letter
        'a' . 'z'
        'A' . 'Z'
        '_'

An indentation is four spaces.

    indentation
        space space space space

Each of the rules is separated by a newline. A rule has a name on one line, with
alternatives indented below it.

    rules
        rule
        rule newline rules

    rule
        name newline nothing alternatives

If the first line after the name of a rule is "", then the rule may match nothing.

    nothing
        ""
        indentation '"' '"' newline

Each alternative is indented on its own line. Each alternative contains items followed
by a newline.

    alternatives
        alternative
        alternative alternatives

    alternative
        indentation items newline

The items are separated by spaces. An item is a literal or the name of a rule.

    items
        item
        item space items

    item
        literal
        name

    literal
        singleton
        range exclude
        '"' characters '"'

Any single Unicode code point except the 32 control codes may be placed within the
single quotes. The hexcode of any Unicode code point may also be placed within the
single quotes. A hexcode can contain 4, 5, or 6 hexadecimal digits.

    singleton
        ''' codepoint '''

    codepoint
        ' ' . '10FFFF'
        hexcode

    hexcode
        "10" hex hex hex hex
        hex hex hex hex hex
        hex hex hex hex

    hex
        '0' . '9'
        'A' . 'F'

A range is specified as a singleton, a .period, and another singleton. Literal ranges
can optionally be followed by -minus sign and characters to be excluded.

    range
        singleton space '.' space singleton

    exclude
        ""
        space '-' space singleton exclude
        space '-' space range exclude

A character wrapped in " (double quote) can be any of the Unicode code points except the
32 control codes and " (double quote). The definition of character shows an example of a
codepoint range and exclude.

    characters
        character
        character characters

    character
        ' ' . '10FFFF' - '"'
