Note:  'master' used to be the name of the main branch in the repository,
but it was renamed to 'main'.

Here's an example of a simple git workflow for my stuff:

        git init                # Create a new repository
        git add a b ...         # Add existing files to the repository

    # Commit these files to the repository

        git commit -m "My message"

        git push                # Upload to the cloud if needed

    # Rinse and repeat...

    # Now main is in good shape (usually).  Suppose I want to work on a new
    # feature and not break main.  We'll do this on a branch.  First make
    # sure main has no modified/staged files.

        git commit ...              # Make sure main is clean

        git switch -c mybranch      # Create new branch and switch to it

    # Do the necessary development work.  If you need to go back to main,
    # make sure there are no staged/changed files (do a commit), then use

        git switch main             # Note your set of files may change

    # Do any work needed on main and commit.  When done, go back to working
    # on mybranch

        git switch mybranch

    # When mybranch is ready, you can merge to main.  First, make sure all
    # stuff on mybranch is committed.
    
        git commit ...          # All stuff on mybranch needs to be committed
        git switch main
        git merge mybranch

    # Usually this completes with no problem.  Conflicts will require work
    # and some e.g. tool like kdiff3, meld, etc.

        git commit ...          # Update main to latest stuff

    # You can delete mybranch if you wish, as its work isn't needed anymore

        git branch -d mybranch

git commit_checksum is 7 digits or more of the hex hash string of the
revision.

Helpful tips
    Note git times are Zulu.

    Listing files
        git status
            --porcelain     Use for scripts, as output syntax constant
            -u untracked
            --ignored
            -s    Short, gives XY status
                  Letters are:
                        ' ' = unmodified
                        M = modified
                        A = added
                        D = deleted
                        R = renamed
                        C = copied
                        U = updated but unmerged
                        ? = untracked
                        ! = ignored

    Saving state
        If you're about to do something drastic that might cause nasty
        changes in a directory, use
 
            git init    # Turn the direction into a git repository
            git add .   # Add everything in the directory to the repository
            git commit -m "First backup"    # Commit the stuff
 
        Now you can do what you want (except things like 'rm -rf *') and
        you can recover the previous state by
 
            git reset --hard    # Restore original version
 
        If the experiment worked, then you can save state for a new nasty
        experiment by
 
            git commit -a -m "Another backup"

    Add, delete, rename
        Add new files with
            git add readme.txt doc ...
        Remove stuff
            git rm other.stuff junk
        Rename
            git mv bug.c feature.c

    Undo/redo
        Show recent commits
            git log
        You can go to a rev using the first few characters of the hash
            git reset --hard 766f
            **********************************************
            * IMPORTANT:  This erases all later commits! *
            **********************************************
        To go to an older version:
            git checkout 82f5
                ** NOTE:  if you make edits, you'll be doing it on a branch **
            git checkout master~5   # 5th-last saved state
        To go to main 
            git checkout master
        To prevent git complaining, always do a commit before using
        checkout using
            git commit -a       # The -a commits all changed files

    Reverting
        Undo a specific commit:
            git commit -a
            git revert 1b6d
        The revert is recorded as a new commit.

    Seeing what's been done
        git diff    # Changes since last commit
        git diff "@{yesterday}"       # Since yesterday
        git diff 1b6d "master~2"      # Between a particular version and 2 back

    Aliases
        Command line:
            git config --global alias.co checkout
        ~/.gitconfig:
            [alias]
                co = checkout

git Tags                                                *git_Tags*

View your tags:
    git tags
    git tag --list 'v*'     # List those that match pattern

Two types:
    * Lightweight:  points to a specific commit:  private/temp labels
        git tag <tagname> [commit_checksum]
    * Annotated:  full object in git database:  meant for releases
        git tag -a <tagname> -m "Commit message" [commit_checksum]

Use 'git show name' to show the details of a tag.

If tags are private to your repo and you just want to change it with the -f
option.  But if the database has been pushed to others, see the "On
Re-tagging" section in the tag manpage.

git push doesn't transfer tags to remote servers.  Use
    git push origin <tagname>
    git push origin --tags
        Pushes all tags that are not already there

Deleting tags
    git tag -d <tagname>
    git push origin --delete <tagname>

To view ths source the tag is pointing to, use
    git checkout <tagname>
    You'll get a message about being in a detached HEAD state.  If you want
    to create a new branch from where you are, use
        git switch -c <new_branch_name>
    Undo this with git switch -

    If you plan to make changes, create and switch to a new branch
        git checkout -b <branch_name> <tag_name>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
git Branching                                           *git_Branching*

Note:  if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes,
git won't let you switch branches.

Switch to existing branch
    git switch name
        Older form is 'git checkout name'
Create a new branch and switch to it
    git switch -c name
Switch back to previously checked-out branch
    git switch -

Listing
    git branch
Deleting
    git branch -d
Renaming
    git branch -m

Use case
    Suppose you're working on something and you need to go back 3
    versions and put in a few print statements:

        git commit -a
        git checkout HEAD~3

            Note: HEAD~ and HEAD^ are equivalent and mean the first parent
            of the item.  HEAD~3 is equivalent to HEAD~~~.

    Now add changes as needed; you can even commit.  Use

        git checkout master 
        git checkout main           For latest versions of git 

    to return to your original work.

    To save the changes, use

        git checkout -b dirty
        git commit -a

    This creates a new named branch 'dirty'.  Go back to it at any time
    with

        git checkout dirty

    In other words, after checking out an old state, git puts you in a
    new unnamed branch, which can be named and saved with 'git checkout
    -b name'.

Quick fix
    You're in the middle of something when you find out there's a bug in
    commit 1b6d:
        git commit -a       # Commit all changed files

        git checkout -b fixes 1b6d
            This creates a new branch from the revision 1b6d and you're now
            working on this branch.

    Once fixed:
        git commit -a -m "Bug fixed"
        git checkout master
            (or git checkout main)

    Now you can merge the fixes to main:

        git merge fixes

    If your local repository is ahead of your remote repository and you
    merge a branch in your local repository, you won't be able to push it
    to the remote.  You'll have to first do a 'git pull' to get the remote
    stuff, then do the push.

Interrupted workflow
    Suppose part1 and part2 of a project are sequential (you need part1
    for part2 to work).  Because of painless branching and merging, we
    can work on part2 before part1 is ready.  

    Let part1 be on the master (or main) branch and it has been committed for
    review.  Create a new branch to work on part2:

    git checkout -b part2

    You can go back and fix things in part1 as needed and as found:

    git checkout master     # Go back to part1
    fix_problem
    git commit -a
    git checkout part2      # Go back to part2
    git merge master        # Merge in the fixes

    When part1 is approved

    git checkout master     # Go back to part1
    submit files            # Release to the world
    git merge part2         # Merge in part2
    git branch -d part2     # Delete the part2 branch

    Now you're in the master branch again with part2 in the working directory.

git Merging                                           *git_Merging*

Here's a common pattern
    
    You've got a problem and you're working on main
    Create a branch to work on the fix:
        
        git switch -c myfix

    When this work is finished, you'll want to merge the changes back to
    main:

        git switch main
        git merge myfix

    For simple stuff, this always works.  When you're satisfied with main
    and how it works, you can delete the myfix branch if you wish:

        git branch -d myfix

Merge conflicts
    The ProGit book talks about merge conflicts on pg 77

    git mergetool starts a GUI that can be used to resolve merge issues.
    You'll need to configure it to use a GUI tool like kdiff3 meld vimdiff,
    etc.

    git status will be needed to verify that all conflicts have been
    resolved.

    For text files, you'll typically see a merged version of the file with
    <<<< and >>>> markers for the conflicting stuff.  You can often resolve
    this manually in your editor for simpler stuff.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Find a bug                                              *git_Find_a_bug*

The code on the master is broken, but you know it was working a few
months ago.  If you've been committing frequently, you can find it
pretty easily:
    git bisect start
    git bisect bad HEAD
    git bisect good 1b6d

git checks out a state halfway between.  Test to see if the bug is
present; if it's still broken
    git bisect bad

If not, replace 'bad' with 'good'.  This results in a binary search that
leads to the commit that caused the problem.  Return to the original
state with
    git bisect reset

You can also automate the search with a script:
    git bisect run my_script

The return value decides the behavior:
    0 means the version is good
    125 means the change should be skipped
    1-127 means the version is bad
    A negative value aborts the bisect.

Blame
    git blame bug.c
    annotates every line in a file showing who last changed it and when.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
git Detached Head                                       *git_DetachedHead*

Suppose you want to go to a particular revision:

    git checkout ffc688

This puts you in 'detached HEAD' state.  You can look around, make
experimental changes, and commit them.  You can discard any commits in this
state WITHOUT impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

The 'git status' command will say '## HEAD (no branch)'.

However, if this experimental work looks promising, use

    git switch -c my_new_branch

Now this stuff is on a new branch.
