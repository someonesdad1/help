DP 29 Sep 1999

This file came from the PDF file PCLFTQR.PDF that is on the 
HP PCL/PJL Reference Set CD, part number 5961-0976 (the CD
is stamped with the number 5961-0975, but I was told the
number to order it by is the first one).  This file was run
through the 0.8 beta version of pdftotext on a Linux system
to convert it to text.  Note in particular that the escape
characters got converted to the '?' character.

*pcl5_Cursor_Positioning *

                          Cursor Positioning 

Cursor positioning can be either absolute or relative. Absolute positioning 
specifies the cursor move distances referenced from the left edge of the 
logical page and the top margin. Relative positioning specifies cursor 
move distances referenced from the current cursor position. Relative 
moves are indicated by using signed numbers (e.g. # = +15 or -122); 
absolute moves are indicated by unsigned numbers (e.g. # = 15 or 122).


Horizontal Cursor Positioning (in Columns) 
  Moves the cursor to a new column on the current line (column width 
  determined by current HMI setting). 
      Esc & a # C 
              # = Column number 
Horizontal Cursor Positioning (in Decipoints) 
  Moves the cursor to a new position along the x-axis.
      Esc & a # H 
              # = Decipoint position (1/720 inch), valid to 2 decimal places. 
Horizontal Cursor Positioning (PCL units) 
  Moves the cursor to a new position along the x-axis.
      Esc * p # X 
              # = Number of PCL units
Horizontal Cursor Positioning Control Codes 
      CR - Carriage-Return
  Moves the cursor to the left margin on the current line.
  (Operation of CR may be modified-see Line Termination command.)
      SP - Space 
  Moves the cursor one column right on the current line for fixed-space font 
  or moves the cursor the HMI distance for proportional fonts when space 
  is a non-printing character. 
      BS - Backspace 
  Moves the cursor left, the distance of the last printed character, on the 
  current line for fixed-space fonts. For proportionally-spaced fonts, 
  backspace moves the cursor back along the current line the distance 
  required to center the overstrike character over the last printed character. 
  Subsequent BS command moves the width of the last printed character.
       HT - Horizontal Tab 
  Moves the cursor to the next tab stop on the current line. (Tab stops are 
  set every 8th column.) 

Vertical Cursor Positioning (Rows) 
 Moves the cursor to a new row in the same column (row distances are 
 determined by the VMI setting). 
     Esc & a # R 
             # = Row number 

Vertical Cursor Positioning (Decipoints) 
 Moves the cursor to a new vertical position along the y-axis.
     Esc & a # V 
             # = Decipoint position (1/720 inch), valid to 4 decimal places.

Vertical Cursor Positioning (PCL units) 
 Moves the cursor to a new dot position along the y-axis. 
     Esc * p # Y 
             # = Number of PCL units

Half Line-Feed 
 Moves the cursor to the same character position one-half line down 
 (distance moved depends on current VMI). 
     Esc = 

Vertical Cursor Positioning Control Codes 
      LF - Line Feed 
 Moves the cursor to the same horizontal position on the next line.
      FF - Form Feed 
 Moves the cursor to the same horizontal position at the top of the next text 
 area. 

Line Termination 
 Controls the way the printer interprets CR, LF, and FF control codes.
     Esc & k # G 
              # =  0 - CR = CR,         LF = LF,       FF = FF
                   1 - CR = CR+LF,      LF = LF,       FF = FF
                   2 - CR = CR,         LF = CR+LF,    FF = CR+FF
                   3 - CR = CR+LF,      LF = CR+LF,    FF = CR+FF

Push/Pop Cursor Position 
 Allows the cursor position to be stored and recalled for later use.
 (Up to 20 positions may be pushed onto the stack) 
     Esc & f # S 
              # = 0 - Push (Store cursor position)
                  1 - Pop (Recall a cursor position) 


                              Font Selection

Any number of fonts may be printed per page, limited only by memory. 
Symbol Set 
  Designates the set of symbols or characters contained in a font. 
     Esc ( ID Primary
     Esc ) ID Secondary 
          ID = Symbol Set identifier
          Common examples:

          ID =  8M - HP Math-8                   0N  - ISO 8859-1 Latin 1
                  8U - HP Roman-8               0O  - OCR A

             text . . . text = Any characters.
                     lblterm = Label terminator (default Ext or defined with

                           in PCL5 Technical Reference Manual).

Label Mode

 Most often used for printing a 2-byte character set such as Kanji.
      LM [mode,[row number]:]
             mode = determines the interpretation mode as follows:
             0        Interprets each byte as a character (8-bit mode).
             1        Interprets the next two bytes as a character (16-bit mode).
             2        Same logic as mode 0 except that vertical substitutes are
                       used if found in a VT segment of the current font.
             3        Same logic as mode 1 except that vertical substitutes are
                       used if found in a VT segment of the current font.
             row number = indicates the first byte while the LB or SM 
             instruction supplys the second byte. Used only in mode 0 when a 
             16-bit character set is selected.

                             1 - opcode value used as ROP value
              opcode = logical operation (ROP3 value)

Pixel Placement
 Specifies either grid intersection or grid-centered pixel placement.
