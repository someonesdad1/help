NOTE:  All commands take the prefix, which is <C-b> by default.  See the
tmux_change_prefix section to change it (I use ctrl-J).

NOTE:  In a command, M means the meta key, which is Alt

Basics                                           *tmux_basics*

Start a tmux session with 'tmux'.  This shows a new 'window' with one
'pane'.  A status line at the bottom shows '0:bash*' as the current window
number 0 and its default name is bash, the shell running.  Time, date, and
computer name are at bottom right.

Split the window vertically into a left and right pane with %.  Switch
between the panes with n and p or use the vi movement keys h and l.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy mode                                           *tmux_copy_mode*

Enter copy mode:        [
Copy buffer into app    ]

- Use vi keys to move around on screen
- Press spacebar to start selecting text
- Hit enter key to copy to tmux's buffer
- Hit <prefix>] to copy the buffer into your shell or app

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sessions                                            *tmux_sessions*

A session is an invocation of tmux that is a collection of pseudoterminals
(see 'man pty').  You can save and restore sessions because a background
process a background server maintains them.

List sessions               s
Rename current session      $
New session
    tmux new -s session-name        
    Using a name lets you reattach more easily
Attach
    tmux attach -t 0
    tmux attach -t session-name
Detach
    d
    tmux detach
List sessions
    tmux ls
Kill session
    tmux kill-session -t session-name

Example
    Basic 
        In a bash window, type 'tmux new -s abcd'.  You'll get a new shell
        window.  Type 'history' to list the history.  Then use 'ctrl-j d'
        to detach it.  

        Use 'tmux ls' and you'll see this session listed.  You can go back
        to it later by the command 'tmux attach -t abcd'.  You should see
        the screen return to what it was when you detached it.

    Good habit
        When you've got a bunch of windows with a goodly amount of data and
        layout, you can detach the session and it will have e.g. a number
        0 if you didn't name it.  You can get back to where you were by
        attaching it again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change the prefix key                               *tmux_configuration*

Edit .tmux.conf to change settings.  Here's my setup:

    # tmux configuration
    # Used in WSL 15 Jan 2024

    # Change the prefix key
    set-option -g prefix C-j
    unbind-key C-b
    bind-key C-j send-prefix
    #set -ag status-style bg=magenta
    # Automatically set window title
    setw -g automatic-rename on
    # Useful stuff from Solomon White in comments about 45% down the page
    # https://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/07/02/tmux-%e2%80%93-the-terminal-multiplexer-part-2/#modifying-tab-color
    # Use the vim motion keys to move between panes
    bind h select-pane -L
    bind j select-pane -D
    bind k select-pane -U
    bind l select-pane -R
    # Use vim motion keys while in copy mode
    setw -g mode-keys vi
    # Modify status line colors
    set -g status-bg green
    set -g status-fg white
    set -g window-status-current-style fg=white
    set -g window-status-current-style bg=red

    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The following came from
    # https://hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/
    # use "|" and "-" to split panes
    bind | split-window -h
    bind - split-window -v

    # Use r to reload the .tmux.conf file, allowing quick experimentation with
    # changing configuration stuff
    bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

    # Pane switching with arrow keys
    bind -n Left select-pane -L
    bind -n Right select-pane -R
    bind -n Up select-pane -U
    bind -n Down select-pane -D

    # Enable mouse control (clickable windows, panes, resizing)
    set -g mouse on

    # Don't rename windows automatically
    set-option -g allow-rename off

Comments
    - Enabling mouse control is very important because you can click to
      change a window and drag the split to resize.
    - A core problem with tmux is that you don't have the buffer that e.g.
      a window in WindowsTerminal has, meaning you can't scroll back to see
      older stuff.
