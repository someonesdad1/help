Some key features of gawk
  - Handles UTF-8 Unicode
  - Can include files in awk code
  - Can load shared libraries in awk code
  - Profiler provides useful picture of where effort was spent
  - Debugger lets you debug a script

Arrays
------
  Only associative arrays.
  Use 'if (var in myarray)' to test for membership.  Don't use
      myarray[var] because it will always define an array element.
  Use 'for (x in myarray)' for iteration.

Command line
------------
  awk [-Fs] 'program' [file1 [file2 ...]]
  awk [-Fs] -f program_file [file1 [file2 ...]]
  -F sets the field separator character to s.  A filename can be of the
    form var=text; it is a variable set to text performed at the time
    the variable would be accessed as a file.

Programs
--------
  Sequence of pattern-action statements and functions:
    pattern { action }
    function name(parameter-list) { statement }

Patterns
--------
  BEGIN
  END
  expression
  /regular expression/
  pattern && pattern
  pattern || pattern
  !pattern
  (pattern)
  pattern, pattern

Actions
-------
  break
  continue
  delete array-element
  do statement while (expression)
  exit [expression]
  expression
  if (expression) statement [else statement]
  input-output statement
  for (expression; expression; expression) statement
  for (variable in array) statement
  next 
  return [expression]
  while (expression) statement
  { statements }

Input/Output       *awk_io*
------------
  close(expr)                   Close file or pipe denoted by expr 
  getline                       Set $0 from next input record; set NF, NR, FNR
  getline <file                 Set $0 from next record of file; set NF
  getline var                   Set var from next input record; set NR, FNR
  getline var <file             Set var from next record of file 
  print                         Print current record 
  print expr-list               Print expressions in expr-list 
  print expr-list >file         Print expressions to file
  printf fmt, expr-list         Format and print 
  printf fmt, expr-list >file   Format and print to file
  system(cmd-line)              Execute command cmd-line; return status

  >> in printf and print append to file and '| cmd' writes to a pipe.
  'cmd | getline' pipes into getline.  getline returns 0 on EOF and 
  -1 on error.

Print formats
-------------
  %c    ASCII character
  %d    Decimal number
  %e    [-]d.ddddddE[+-]dd
  %f    [-]ddd.dddddd
  %g    e or f conversion, whichever is shorter, with nonsignificant 
          zeroes suppressed
  %o    Unsigned octal number
  %s    String
  %x    Unsigned hexadecimal number
  %%    Print a %

Built-in Variables      *awk_variables*
------------------
  ARGC        Number of command line arguments
  ARGV        Array of command line arguments (ARGV[0..ARGC-1])
  FILENAME    Name of current input file
  FNR         Input record number in current file
  FS          Input field separator (default blank)
  NF          Number of fields in current input record
  NR          Input record number since beginning
  OFMT        Output format for numbers (default "%.6g")

  ORS         Output record separator (default newline)
  RLENGTH     Length of string matched by regexp in match
  RS          Input record separator (default newline)
  RSTART      Beginning position of string matched by match
  SUBSEP      Separator for array subscripts of form [i,j,...] (default "\034")

Functions
---------

  Any variable in a function's parameters is a local variable.  All other variable
  references are to global variables.  It's an inelegant design, but at least the
  needed local variables are there.

Built-in String Functions                     *awk_string_functions*
-------------------------
  s and t are strings, r a regexp, i and n integers.
  An & in s in sub and gsub is replaced by the matched string.
  String counting begins at 1.

  gsub(r, s, t)             Globally substitute s for each substring of t 
                             matched by r.  Return number of substitutions.  
                             If t omitted, use $0.
  index(s, t)               Return the index of t in s or 0 if not contained.
  length(s)                 Return the length of s.
  match(s, r)               Return index of where s matches r or 0 if there
                             is no match.  Set RSTART and RLENGTH.
  split(s, a, fs)           Split s into array a on fs, return number of 
                             fields.  If fs is omitted, FS is used.
  sprintf(fmt, expr-list)   Return expr-list formatted according to fmt.
  sub(r, s, t)              Like gsub except only first matched string is
                             replaced.
  substr(s, i, n)           Return the n character substring of s starting
                             at i; if n is omitted, return the suffix of s
                             starting at i.

Built-in arithmetic functions
-----------------------------
  (Trig angles are in radians)
  atan2(y,x)  Arctangent of y/x from -pi to pi
  cos(x)      Cosine
  exp(x)      Exponential
  int(x)      Truncate to integer
  log(x)      Natural logarithm
  rand()      Pseudo-random number >= 0 and < 1.
  sin(x)      Sine
  sqrt(x)     Square root
  srand(x)    New seed for rand().  Uses time of day if no x given.

Expression operators (Highest precedence first)
--------------------
  $
  ++ --
  ^
  + - !
  * / %
  + -
  < <= > >= != ==
  ~ !~
  in
  &&
  ||
  ?:
  = += -= *= /= %= ^=
  All are left associative except assignment, ?:, and ^.

Regular Expressions
-------------------
  Metacharacters are  \  ^  $  .  [  ]  |  (  )  *  +  ?
  The operators are listed with highest precedence first.

  (r)          Matches the same strings as r
  (r)?         Matches the null string or one string matched by r
  (r)+         Matches 1 or more consecutive strings matched by r
  (r)*         Matches 0 or more consecutive strings matched by r
  (r1)(r2)     Matches xy where r1 matches x and r2 matches y
  r1|r2        Matches any string matched by r1 or r2
  [^abc...]    Negated character class:  matches any single char except abc...
  [abc...]     Character class:  matches any of abc...
  .            Matches any single character
  $            Matches end of string
  ^            Matches beginning of string
  \c           Matches the escape sequence or literal character c
  c            Matches the character c

Escape sequences
----------------
  Have special meanings in strings and regular expressions

  \b    Backspace
  \f    Formfeed
  \n    Newline
  \r    Carriage return
  \t    Tab
  \ddd  Octal value ddd
  \c    Any other character c literally

Initialization, comparison, type coercion
-----------------------------------------

Each variable and field can potentially be a string or a number or both
at any time.  When a variable is set by an assignment

      var = expr

its type is set to that of the expression.  An arithmetic expression is 
of type number, a concatenation is of type string, and so on.  If the 
assignment is a simple copy, as in v1 = v2, then the type of v1 is set
to that of v2.

In comparisons, if both operands are numeric, the comparison is made
numerically.  Otherwise, operands are coerced to string if necessary, 
and the comparison is made on strings.  The type of any expression can
be coerced to numeric by subterfuges such as 

    expr + 0

and to string by

    expr ""

(i.e., concatenation with a null string).  The numeric value of an 
arbitrary string is the numeric value of its numeric prefix.

Unitialized variables have the numeric value 0 and string value "".
Accordingly, if x is unitialized,

    if (x) ...

is false, and 

    if (!x) ...
    if (x == 0) ...
    if (x == "") ...

are all true.  But not that 

    if (x == "0") ...

is false.

The type of a field is determined by context when possible; for example,

    $1++

implies that $1 must be coerced to numeric if necessary, and

    $1 = $1 "," $2

implies that $1 and $2 will be coerced to strings if necessary.

In contexts where types cannot be reliably determined, e.g., 

    if ($1 == $2) ...

the type of each field is determined on input.  All fields are strings;
in addition, each field that contains only a number is also considered
numeric.

Fields that are explicitly null have the string value ""; they are not
numeric.  Nonexistant fields (i.e., fields past NF) and $0 for blank 
lines are treated this way too.

As it is for fields, so it is for array elements created by split.

Mentioning a variable in an expression causes it to exist, with the 
values 0 and "" as described above.  Thus, if arr[i] does not currently
exist, 

   if (arr[i] == "") ...

causes it to exist with the value "" and thus the if is satisfied.  The
test 

   if (i in arr) ...

determines if arr[i] exists without the side effect of creating it.

Examples
--------

    Sum a column of numbers from stdin:
        awk '
            BEGIN {
                total = 0
            }
            { 
                total += $1 
            }
            END { 
                printf("Total = %g\n", total) 
            }'
    Note the syntax requires the opening brace for the BEGIN and END
    blocks on the same line.
