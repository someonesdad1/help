vim on latex files
    Somehow the formatting of bulleted lists gets screwed up when editing a
    *.tex file.  A quick fix is to make a soft link to it as a file name
    like 'a'; then you can use the paragraph formatting.

Basic document structure
    <preamble:  say what packages to use, settings, etc.>
    % A comment
    \begin{document}
        <document's text>
    \end{document}
        <anything here is ignored, so you can use it for e.g. a todo list>

Setting body text to sans serif and formulas to computer modern

Font sizes                                              *latex_font_sizes*

The following fonts sizes are used when you use the 10, 11, 12 point
document font size option in \documentclass.

Command                 10pt    11pt    12pt
\tiny                   5       6       6
\scriptsize             7       8       8
\footnotesize           8       9       10
\small                  9       10      10.95
\normalsize (default)   10      10.95   12
\large                  12      12      14.4

Bibtex                                                  *latex_bibtex*

The Citekey can be any alphanumeric characters or one of  '-_:'.

+ means a required field.  Field names are case-insensitive and field order
is unimportant.

Numbers with only digits can eliminate the braces; strings must be inside
{...}.  Note the 'and' between authors.  Probably the best form for
authors' names is 'lastname, firstname', as the comma allows you to use
'Guevara de la Serna, Ernesto', as 'Ernesto Guevara de la Serna' will cause
bibtex to use 'de la Serna' for the last name, which is incorrect.

*latex_tables*

Use the array package
    \usepackage{array}

Consult https://latex-tutorial.com/tables-in-latex for examples of use

Here's a handy use in the AnalyticGeometry project in the series.tex file.
Note 1) the p use to control the column width and 2) that the cell contents
can wrap.
