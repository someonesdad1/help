Features                                                *winmerge_features*

- File comparisons (2-way and 3-way)
- Recursive directory compares
- Compare images
- Compare CSV and tab-separated files in table format
- Binary comparisons (hex dump format)

Tips

- Binary compare:  use ctrl-O to get open dialog; select files and click on down arrow
  in the Compare button to select binary.
- The down arrow in the Compare button has an All button; click on Select and you get a
  dialog to choose the plugin to use
- Compare two directories from the command line without recursion with the -r- option.
  In View, if you turn off 'Show Left Unique' and 'Show Right Unique', you'll see files
  with common names.  This was useful to show me a number of /plib and /plib/pgm
  duplicate files with different content.

-r
    Compares all files in all subfolders (recursive compare). Unique folders (occurring
    only on one side) are listed in the compare result as separate items. Note that
    including subfolders can increase compare time significantly. Without this
    parameter, WinMerge lists only files and subfolders at the top level of the two
    target folders. It does not compare the subfolders.
-r-
    Compares all files within the specified folders but excludes the files and
    subfolders within its subfolders. This allows for a shorter comparison time.
-e
    Enables you to close WinMerge with a single Esc key press. This is useful when you
    use WinMerge as an external compare application: you can close WinMerge quickly,
    like a dialog. Without this parameter, you might have to press Esc multiple times to
    close all its windows.
-f
    Applies a specified filter to restrict the comparison. The filter can be a filemask
    like *.h *.cpp, or the name of a file filter like XML/HTML Devel. Add quotation
    marks around a filter mask or name that contains spaces.
-m compare-method
    Sets the compare method to use for the comparison. This can be one of the keywords
    Full, Quick, Binary, Date, SizeDate, Size or Existence.
-t window-type
    Specifies the type of window in which to display files. This can be one of the
    keywords Text, Table, Binary, Image or Webpage.
-x
    Closes WinMerge (after displaying an information dialog) when you start a comparison
    of identical files. The parameter has no effect after the comparison, for example if
    the files become identical as a result of merging or editing. This parameter is
    useful when you use WinMerge as an external compare application, or when you want to
    eliminate unnecessary steps by ignoring files that don't have any differences.
-xq
    Is similar to -x but does not show the message about identical files.
-s
    Limits WinMerge windows to a single instance. For example, if WinMerge is already
    running, a new compare opens in the same instance. Without this parameter, multiple
    windows are allowed: depending on other settings, a new compare might open in the
    existing window or in a new window.
-sw
    Limit the WinMerge window to one instance as well as the option -s. However, it
    waits for the instance displaying the window to terminate. 
-s-
    Ensure that another instance is always executed, ignoring the value of the "Allow
    only one instance to run" option.
-ul
    Prevents WinMerge from adding the left path to the Most Recently Used (MRU) list.
    External applications should not add paths to the MRU list in the Select Files or
    Folders dialog.
-um
    Prevents WinMerge from adding the middle path to the Most Recently Used (MRU) list.
    External applications should not add paths to the MRU list in the Select Files or
    Folders dialog.
-ur
    Prevents WinMerge from adding the right path to the Most Recently Used (MRU) list.
    External applications should not add paths to the MRU list in the Select Files or
    Folders dialog.
-u
    Prevents WinMerge from adding either path (left or right) to the Most Recently Used
    (MRU) list. External applications should not add paths to the MRU list in the Select
    Files or Folders dialog.
-wl
    Opens the left side as read-only. Use this when you don't want to change left side
    items in the compare.
-wm
    Opens the middle side as read-only. Use this when you don't want to change right
    side items in the compare.
-wr
    Opens the right side as read-only. Use this when you don't want to change right side
    items in the compare.
-new
    Opens a new blank window.
-self-compare
    Compares the specified file with a copy of the file.
-clipboard-compare
    Compares the two most recent contents of the clipboard history.
-minimize
    Starts WinMerge as a minimized window. This option can be useful during lengthy
    compares.
-maximize
    Starts WinMerge as a maximized window.
-fl
    Sets focus to the left side at startup.
-fm
    Sets focus to the middle side at startup.
-fr
    Sets focus to the right side at startup.
-l linenumber
    Specifies a line number to jump to after loading the files.
-c charpos
    Specifies a character position to jump to after loading the files.
-table-delimiter delimiter
    Specifies a delimiter character for table editing. To specify a tab character,
    specify "tab", "\t", or "\x09".
-dl
    Specifies a description in the left side title bar, overriding the default folder or
    filename text. For example: -dl "Version 1.0" or -dl WorkingCopy. Use quotation
    marks around descriptions that contain spaces.
-dm
    Specifies a description in the middle side title bar, just like -dl.
-dr
    Specifies a description in the right side title bar, just like -dl.
-al
    Auto-merges at the left side at startup.
-am
    Auto-merges at the middle side at startup.
-ar
    Auto-merges at the right side at startup.
-noninteractive
    Runs WinMerge without displaying message boxes during comparison or report
    generation. The process terminates automatically when the operation is complete,
    making it suitable for batch or scripted execution. 
-noprefs
    Runs WinMerge without loading or saving settings from the registry. All comparisons
    use default preferences only. 
-enableexitcode
    Sets the comparison result to the process exit code. 0: identical, 1: different, 2:
    error
-ignorews
    Controls the "Whitespaces" option (whitespace comparison settings) persistently:

        -ignorews:0 - do not ignore whitespace differences.
        -ignorews or -ignorews:1 - ignore differences in the amount of whitespace.
        -ignorews:2 - ignore all whitespace characters.
-ignoreblanklines
    Controls the "Ignore blank lines" option persistently:
        -ignoreblanklines:0 - disables ignoring blank lines.
        -ignoreblanklines or -ignoreblanklines:1 - enables ignoring blank lines.
-ignorecase
    Controls the "Ignore case" option persistently:
        -ignorecase:0 - disables ignoring case differences.
        -ignorecase or -ignorecase:1 - enables ignoring case differences.
-ignoreeol
    Controls the "Ignore EOL differences" option persistently:
        -ignoreeol:0 - disables ignoring EOL differences.
        -ignoreeol or -ignoreeol:1 - enables ignoring EOL differences.
-ignorecodepage
    Controls the "Ignore codepage differences" option persistently:
        -ignorecodepage:0 - disables ignoring codepage differences.
        -ignorecodepage or -ignorecodepage:1 - enables ignoring codepage differences.
-ignorecomments
    Controls the "Ignore comment differences" option persistently:
        -ignorecomments:0 - disables ignoring comments.
        -ignorecomments or -ignorecomments:1 - enables ignoring comments.
-unpacker plugin pipeline
    Specifies the plugin pipeline for the Unpacker plugin. Example: -unpacker
    "SortAscending|SelectLines 1-10" 
-prediffer plugin pipeline
    Specifies the plugin pipeline for the Prediffer plugin. Example: -prediffer
    "IgnoreColumns 1-10" 
-cp codepage
    Specifies the codepage to use for file comparison. Example: -cp 65001 
-fileext file-extension
    Specifies a file extension for determining syntax hightliting.
-cfg name=value
    Sets a configuration value in the WinMerge registry or INI file.

    Example: -cfg Settings/DiffAlgorithm=3

    If the section name is unambiguous and does not conflict with other setting names,
    it can be omitted:

    -cfg DiffAlgo=3

    Note: This entry does not explain which configuration names are available. For a
    list of settings, refer to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Thingamahoochie\WinMerge in
    regedit.
leftpath
    Specifies the folder, file or project file to open on the left side.
middlepath
    Specifies the folder, file or project file to open on the middle side.
rightpath
    Specifies the folder, file or project file to open on the right side.

    WinMerge cannot compare files to folders, so the path parameters (leftpath,
    middlepath and rightpath) must point to the same target type (either folders or
    files). If WinMerge cannot find either of the specified paths, it opens the Select
    Files or Folders dialog, where you can browse for the correct paths.  Tip

    In file comparisons, you can specify a folder name in one of the path parameters, as
    long as the folder contains a file with the same name as the one specified in the
    other, file path.

    For example, consider this command:

    WinMergeU C:\Folder\File.txt C:\Folder2

    If C:\Folder2 contains a file named File.txt: WinMerge implicitly resolves the
    second path as a file specification, and compares the two files. Of course, the
    command is invalid if C:\Folder2 does not contain a file named File.txt.
-o outputpath
    Specifies an optional output file path where you want merged result files to be
    saved.

    The output path is rarely needed when you start WinMerge from the command line. It
    is meant to be used with version control tools, where you might need to specify a
    output path for the result file. If you specify a output path, WinMerge still shows
    only two or three files in the File Compare window. However, if you save either of
    these files, it is written to the output path, leaving the two or three source files
    intact.

    Version control systems typically refer to the source and result files using terms
    like theirs, mine, and either merged or resolved. If you specify a output path on
    the WinMerge command line, and are working with a version control system, you should
    list the files in that order.
-or outputpath
    Outputs a comparison report for files or folders. Example: 
        WinMergeU path1 path2 -or c:\tmp\report.html
    It is often useful to combine this option with:

        -noninteractive - exits WinMerge after producing the report.

        -minimize - starts WinMerge in minimized state.

        -noprefs - ignores the current preferences and uses default settings. Any
        changes made with -cfg will then be temporary and not saved.

    The following -cfg settings can also be useful (parameter names may change in the
    future):

    For file comparisons:

        -cfg Settings/DiffContextV2=0 - hides matching lines in the report (equivalent
        to View -> Diff Context -> 0 Lines).

        -cfg Settings/ViewLineNumbers=1 - outputs line numbers (set to 0 to disable).

    For folder comparisons:

        -cfg Settings/DirViewExpandSubdirs=1 - automatically expand all subfolders.

        -cfg ReportFiles/ReportType=2 - report style: Simple HTML.

        -cfg ReportFiles/IncludeFileCmpReport=1 - include file comparison reports.
conflictfile
    Specifies a conflict file, typically generated by a Version control system. The
    conflict file opens in the File Compare window, where you can merge and resolve
    conflicts, as described in Resolving conflict files. Note that no other paths can be
    used with a conflict file.
-inifile inifile
    specifies an INI file used to load and save settings instead of the registry.

changed the options to use dash characters, as I only use this tool from cygwin or WSL.
