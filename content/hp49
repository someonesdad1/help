    11. Special Functions, 1.  If flag 117 (choose boxes) is off, you
    can get to the soft key by pressing NXT.  Note there are a number
    of useful functions under REAL:  mantissa, exponent, IP, FP, etc.

Use red UNITS to add units to a quantity.  Then calculations can be
performed with dimensionally consistent numbers.

To get to physical constants, use red CAT, then ALPHA C and scroll to
CONLIB.  Press the needed softkeys and copy the value to the stack.

blue S.SLV
    To solve an equation for a variable, enter the equation onto the
    stack, enter the variable to isolate, then execute ISOL.  Example
        a*t^3 - b*t
        t
        ISOL

    yields
        t=0, t=sqrt(a*b)/a, t=sqrt(a*b)/a

        You also can use SOLVE and ZEROES.

red NUM.SLV
    Numerical roots

Programs
    Go to the directory where you want the program to reside (use FILES).
    Then use NEW (press NXT) to create a new program.  Use the red
    << >> key (the + key) to create a program object.  Save it, then
    press VAR to get the variable names in the softkeys.  Enter your
    data and press the softkey for the program.

Roots of polynomials
    Enter the coefficients in decreasing power order into an array
    (use the [] brackets).  Then under the ARITH (blue 1) menu, pick
    POLY, NXT, NXT and press PROOT.  The roots will be returned in an
    array.  You can also do this problem using the NUM.SLV - Poly 
    entry (red 7).

    Given an array of the roots of a polynomial, use PCOEF to calculate
    the polynomial (it's next to PROOT).

Roots

        EXTR      Find the extremum
        TANL      Show the tangent line equation

    Press EDIT NXT LABEL MENU to see a labelled graph.

    Use blue TABLE to see a tabulated list of function values.  You 
    control the table characteristics in blue TBLSET.  

    Enter a function and execute TABVAR on it.  You'll get a statement
    about the domain and range of the function.  The function needs to
    be reducible to a rational expression.  Example:

        For (X-3)/(X^2+2*X-7), we get
            -inf - -(1+2*sqrt(2)) - 3-2*sqrt(2) + ...
            0 down inf down (2+sqrt(2))/8 ...
        The first line shows the first interval of (-inf, -(1+2*sqrt(2)));
        the second line shows that the function is zero at -inf, decreasing 
        in this interval, and going to infinity at the right endpoint.

Taylor Series
    CALC/LIMITS&SERIES
        TAYLOR0
            Maclaurin expansion of function, 4th order relative power
        TAYLR
            Taylor series expansion:
                TAYLR(sin(s-pi/2), s, 6)
                Params are function, variable, and order of the series.

Differentiation and Integration
    Symbolic
        Go to blue CALC menu (blue 4).  Enter equation using EQW and 
        the default independent variable (usually X).  Then press 
        DERVX or INTVX to calculate the derivative or integral wrt X.

Multivariate functions
    Use blue DEF (2) to define a function:
        DEF('F(X,Y)=X*COS(Y)')
    This creates a variable named F.  Enter 'F(1, 2)' and it will be
    evaluated.

    Use DERVX, DERIV, and the partial operator to get partial derivatives.

Vector Calculus
    Note:  to enter a vector, use square brackets and single quotes for
    each component, separated by a comma or space: ['x' 'x^2*y' 'z*x']

    Gradient:  use DERIV:
        DERIV(X^2+Z*Y^2, [X,Y,Z]), which returns
        [2*X,Z*(2*Y),Y^2]

        You can use the following function to calculate the gradient of 
        a function in the X register:
            << X Y Z 3 -> ARRY DERIV >>

    Potential:  use POTENTIAL to calculate the potential of a vector
        field.  Example:
            POTENTIAL([x y z],[x y z]) gives
            SQ(x)/2 + SQ(y)/2 + SQ(z)/2
        You'll get an error if no potential function exists.

    Divergence:  use DIV.  Example:
        DIV([X Y Z],[X Y Z]) gives 3.

    Laplacian:  use LAPL.

    Curl:  use CURL.

    Vector potential:  use VPOTENTIAL.  For a vector field F, gives the
        field Phi such at the curl of Phi is F.  The vector potential 
        will exist only if the divergence of F is zero.

Probability
    Normal CDF:  UTPN (upper tail for normal distribution) for P(X > x)
        UTPN(mean, variance, value)

    Student's T:  UTPT(df, t)

    Chi square:  UTPC(df, x)


    F:  UTPF(vN, vD, F)


Custom Menus
    Use MENU for a permanent menu (creates a CST variable) and TMENU for
    a temporary menu.  Example:
        {EXP LN GAMMA} TMENU

Sums
    Use EQW to enter sums by red sin.  Example:
        sum(1, inf, i, 1/i^2) = pi^2/6

Units
    A number followed by an underscore and a unit can be typed in.  It's
    easier to use the red UNITS (6) to get to the softkeys.

    You can prepend SI prefixes if desired.  To do this, type in the number,
    underscore (red -), the prefix, and the unit.

    CONVE   Put unit in level 2, unit to be converted to in level 1 & convert
            Magnitude of level 1 not important.
    UBASE   Show the existing units in SI.
    UVAL    Strip off units.
    UFACT   Express level 2 in the units in level 1.
    ->UNIT  Put unit in level 1 onto number in level 2.

Special Physical Functions
    117 MENU gives:
        ZFACTOR     Gas compressibility factor for hydrocarbons
                    ZFACTOR(reduced temperature, reduced pressure)
        FANNING     Fanning friction factor for aerodynamics (1/4 times the
                    Darcy function)
        DARCY       Darcy-Weisbach friction factor
                    Darcy(eps/D, Re) where eps is the roughness and D
                    is the pipe diameter.  See below for Re.
        F0lambda    Black body emissive power between 0 and lambda
                    F0lambda(T, lambda)
        SIDENS      Silicon intrinsic density in 1/cm^3 for temp in K.
        TDELTA      Temperature delta function.  For T1 in level 1 and
                    T2 in level 2, returns T1 - T2 in units of T1.  Conversion
                    is done if necessary.
        TINC        Same as TDELTA, but adds the temperatures.

    Reynolds number:  ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces.

        Re = rho*v*L/mu

        rho = fluid density (kg/m^3)
        v   = mean fluid velocity (m/s)
        L   = characteristic length (m).  For flow in circular pipes, is 
              the diameter.  Is hydraulic diameter = 4*A/P for noncircular
              cross sections; A = cross-sectional area, P = wetted perimeter
        mu  = absolute dynamic viscosity (Pa*s)

        For pipes, below about Re = 2300, flow is generally accepted
        as laminar.  Above about Re = 3000, flow is turbulent.  In
        between it's called transition flow, with characteristics of
        both laminar and turbulent flow.

Functions
    Enter an equation such as
        Name(X, Y) = exp(X) - ln(Y)
    and press blue DEF (2).  This will define a function with a softkey 
    of F (press VAR to see) that takes two arguments:  X in level 2 and 
    Y in level 1.  Press the softkey to evaluate the function.

Straight Line
    Enter 2 complex numbers and execute DROITE.  You'll get the equation
    of the straight line between those two points in slope-intercept form.
