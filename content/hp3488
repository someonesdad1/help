To use the SYNTAX key on the front panel:  press SYNTAX followed by
the operation of interest.  The display will show a syntax summary.
It may also give a reference number n; press SYNTAX n and you'll get
more details.  Example

    SYNTAX CLOSE gives
        CLOSE <ADDRESS>[,<ADDRESS>]...; SEE REFERENCE 5 FOR ADDRESS
    Scroll the message with the arrow keys
    SYNTAX 5 gives
        ADDRESS:  A THREE DIGIT NUMBER WITH THE FIRST NUMBER BEING
        SLOT AND THE NEXT TWO DIGITS BEING EITHER A RELAY NUMBER OR
        BIT NUMBER

Connecting:

    import visa
    nl = "\n"
    addr = 15
    io = visa.Instrument("GPIB0::%d" % addr, term_chars="")
    # Then communications can done by appending newline
    io.write("close 101" + nl)
    # View channel state
    io.write("view 101" + nl)
    s = io.read()
    print s

    will yield "CLOSED 0".  0 means closed, 1 means open (think of a
    pullup resistor on the line and you're measuring for a voltage).

The unit I have has the following setup:
    Slot   Model   Description
    ----   -----   -----------
     1     44470   RELAY MUX
     2     44470   RELAY MUX
     3     44470   RELAY MUX
     4     44474   DIGITAL IO
     5     44474   DIGITAL IO

  The 44470 has 10 relays and switches one pair of lines to a common
  high and low.  The intent is use with a voltmeter to mux sources.

  The 44474 is a 16 channel digital I/O card.

Setups:  there are 40 channels (1 to 40) to store and recall setups.

*Scanner_Commands*

c = a slot + channel number; e.g. 105
s = a slot number, 1 to 5
p = a digital output port (8-bit:  00 and 01, 16-bit: 02)
D = a number (8-bit or 16-bit)
n = a decimal number

CHAN [c]
    Open any chanel previously closed with CHAN or STEP, then close
    the indicated channel number.  If no argument, returns the last
    channel closed by CHAN or STEP.
CLEAR
    Same as RESET.
CLOSE c[,c, ...]
    Close indicated channels
CMON s
    Display slot monitor for the indicated slot.
CPAIR
    CPAIR n,m sets up cards n and m to operate as a pair.  Can use
    CLOSE, OPEN, CRESET, CHAN, and STEP.  Useful for e.g. 4 wire
    resistance measurements.  With no arguments, returns the current
    card pair.
CRESET s[s, ...]
    Open all channels on card.
CTYPE s
    Returns card type (description & model number)
DBR <s><p>,[number of times to read]
    Digital binary read.  See manual pg. 77.
DBW <s><p>,#I<block of data>
    Digital binary write.  "DBW502,#IAS" sends the "AS" as a block of
    data.  See manual pg. 77.
DELAY
    Used when using the External Increment and Channel Closed
    features of 44474 digital I/O card.  See pg 65 of manual.
DISP <string>
    Write a string up to 127 characters to the display.  Any character
    32 and above can be displayed except for '#' and ':' (which are
    string termination characters).  Any characters > 127 will be
    discarded.  Quotes are ignored.
DMODE s[,<mode>][,<polarity>][,<EI>]
    Establish handshake and polarity of 44474 digital I/O card.
    Mode
        1: static (default), 2: static2 (read what was written),
        3: R/W & strobe, 4: read & write strobe, 5:  handshake (no
        Ext. Inc.)
    Polarity
        Lower byte polarity         1 = low true
        Upper byte polarity         2 = low true
        PCTL Polarity (low ready)   4 = low busy
        PFLG Polarity (low ready)   8 = low busy
        I/O direction line polarity 16 = low input mode
        (High = input mode normally)
 
    External Increment and Channel Closed is enabled by a 1 in the EI
    specifier.  They are disabled with 0.
 
    'DMODE s' reads the register.
    At power on, in static mode, high true logic, EI/CC disabled
DOFF
    Display off.
DON
    Display on.  Can also be used to erase a message sent with DISP.
DREAD <s><p>,[, <number of times to read>]
    Read the digital port number.  8-bit port values will be
    between 0 and 255.  16-bit will be 2's complement between -32768
    and 32767.
DWRITE <s><p>, D [, D...]
    Write data D to port p of slot s.  8-bit port values must be
    between 0 and 255.  16-bit must be 2's complement between -32768
    and 32767.
EHALT <0 or 1>
    Stop on an error if enabled (1).  If enabled, an error locks up
    the HPIB; you can clear it using the HPIB clear command or
    pressing the LOCAL key on the front panel.
ERROR
    Read error register decimal number:

        1   Syntax error
        2   Execution error; possible meanings:
                a.  Parameter out of range
                b.  Card type mismatch
                c.  Attempt to access nonexistent stored state or scan list
        4   Hardware trigger too fast
        8   Logic failure
        16  Power supply failure
ID?
    Causes the device to output the string "HP3488A".
LOCK <0 or 1>
    If 1, locks out the keyboard.  0 deactivates the lock.  Prevents
    the keyboard from being scanned, permitting faster operation.
MASK n
    Set the SRQ mask (i.e., conditions that will cause an SRQ):
        Bit     Value       Description
        0       1           End of scan sequence
        1       2           Output available
        2       4           Power-on SRQ true
        3       8           Front panel SRQ key pressed
        4       16          Ready for instructions
        5       32          Error
        6                   RQS (This bit is not maskable)
        7                   Not used
    If no n is given, read the MASK decimal number.
OPEN  c[, c, c...]      
    Open indicated channels
RECALL n
    Recall the stored state in register n.  n must be 1 to 40.
    If no state was stored in n, then an error results and the 3488
    remains in its previous state.
RESET
    Resets the 3488 to power-on state.  This opens all relays and
    reads GPIB address switch.  Stored states are not destroyed.
SLIST
    Scan list to scan through.  Example:  SLIST 104,300-309,403  
    Operation is break before make.  Wraps around to first channel.
    Press or execute STEP to go to next channel.  Use 0 as a stop
    channel; the last channel scanned is opened and the scan stops.
    Scanning works for relays or digital I/O.
STATUS
    Read status byte; returns decimal value.
    Bits are
        Bit     Value       Definition
        0   *   1           End of scan sequence
        1       2           Output available
        2   *   4           Power-on SRQ asserted
        3   *   8           Front panel SRQ key pressed
        4       16          Ready for instructions
        5       32          Error
        6       64          RQS
        7       128         Not used
    * means cleared after STATUS command executed.
STEP
    Steps to the next channel.  See SLIST.
STORE n
    Store the current channel setup in register 1 to 40.  Maintained
    across power cycles & resets.  44474 cards not in static mode are
    ignored.
TEST
    Perform internal self-test.  Read back from the command; "0" means
    all tests passed.
VIEW c
    Show channel state on display

*Details_44470*

10 channel relay multiplexer.  10 channels of 2 wires connect to a
common 2-wire bus.  The relays have low thermal offsets.  Relays are
rated 250 V @ 2 A and can be operated in break before make or where
multiple channels may be closed together.

The primary use of this card is for multiplexing signals to a
voltmeter.  Note you can use two of these cards with the CPAIR (card
pair) command to effect 4-wire resistance measurements.
