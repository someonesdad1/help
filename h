# Help launcher

# This script is used to launch my help files, viewing them in vim.  With no arguments, open
# output/index.hld in vim to allow access to all the help files 

# With one argument, make it lowercase and append .hld; if it matches a file in
# output/, open this file.  Otherwise, the argument is a case-sensitive regex; open all the *.hld
# files that contain it.

        # index_file    Core index file for the help files 
        # filelist      List of *.hld files in $helpdir

    # Extension of the help files.  In my .vimrc, this is accomanied by 
    #   'autocmd BufRead *.hld source $dpvim/syntax/donhelp.vim'
    # which provides syntax coloring.  I also use 
    #   'autocmd BufRead *.hld noremap q :q!<cr>:unmap q'
    # to allow me to quit using the 'q' key.  Also,
    #   'autocmd BufRead *.hld noremap t ^T' 
    # lets me use the 't' key to return from a jump to a tag.
